General information
=========

This project only implements one of the MPI function â€” [MPI_Bcast].

It is usefull and faster than MPI realization on the data arrays with number of elements more or equal to 1024, in other cases MPI realization is preferred.

It was tested only on Regatta machine. Results may vary on BlueGene architectures

Typical compareness of RMB and MPI realizations looks like here (left is length of data array and bottom is time to broadcast it 1000 times):
